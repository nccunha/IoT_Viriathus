# This "bridge" script subscribes to messages inside the 6LoWPAN network using unencrypted MQTT
# and then publishes the messages securely to the MQTT broker in the AWS cloud using TLS/SSL

# You can easily change this script, in case you need to subscribe to topics from the AWS cloud 
# and publish them locally in the 6LoWPAN network.

# Libraries:
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
import ssl
import sys


############ Please change these parameters for your own setup #########


# There is a Mosquitto server running locally on the Virtual Machine (for tunslip use). 
# For border router use, you should change this to the IPv6 server of the local MQTT broker:
LOCAL_MQTT_URL = "localhost"
# You may also try "test.mosquitto.org"

# A topic to publish information about the zolertia board(s):	 
SENSORS_TOPIC = "zolertia/sensor_status"

# Address of the Cloud MQTT Broker:
CLOUD_MQTT_URL = ""
CERTIFICATE_AUTH_FILE = ""
CERT_PEM_FILE = ""
PRIVATE_KEY_FILE = ""

# A topic to get information from the cloud:	 
CLOUD_TOPIC = "cloud/action"

# Callback for initial local network connection:
def on_connect(local_client, userdata, flags, rc):
    print("Connected to local MQTT broker with result code " + str(rc))
    local_client.subscribe(SENSORS_TOPIC)
    print("Subscribed to local topic: " + SENSORS_TOPIC + "\n")

# Callback for received message in the local network:
def on_local_message(local_client, userdata, msg):
    #publish the exact same message on the MQTT broker in the cloud:
    print("Local -> Cloud: Topic [" + msg.topic + "]. Msg \""+str(msg.payload)+"\"")
    cloud_client.publish(msg.topic,str(msg.payload))

# Callback for received message in the cloud:

# 1st connect to the Cloud MQTT Client:
cloud_client=mqtt.Client() 
cloud_client.on_message = on_cloud_message

print("Connecting to the Cloud at " + CLOUD_MQTT_URL + "...")
cloud_client.tls_set(CERTIFICATE_AUTH_FILE, CERT_PEM_FILE, PRIVATE_KEY_FILE, tls_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)

print("Connected to the Cloud MQTT Broker.")
cloud_client.subscribe(CLOUD_TOPIC)
print("Subscribed to cloud topic: " + CLOUD_TOPIC + "\n")

# Then conect to the Local MQTT Client:
local_client = mqtt.Client()
local_client.on_connect = on_connect
local_client.on_message = on_local_message

print("Connecting locally to " + LOCAL_MQTT_URL + "...")
local_client.connect(LOCAL_MQTT_URL, 1883, 60)

# If we had just 1 connection we coud use client.loop_forever()
# since we have two, we'll use a while loop this way:

try:
   while True:
        local_client.loop(0.01) # timeout of 0.01 secs (max 100Hz)
        cloud_client.loop(0.01)

except (KeyboardInterrupt): #catch keyboard interrupts
        sys.exit()


# You can test by running on your VM:
# mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t zolertia/sensor_status -m $'{\n  "message": "Publiquei esta msg localmente e a bridge fez forward para a cloud"\n}'

# Also test publishing something in the cloud and check if you receive it locally with:
# mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t cloud/action
